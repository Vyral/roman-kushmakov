Here are the three reasons why you should hire the Roman Group to sell your home.&nbsp;

First, **we offer a communication guarantee.** According to the NAR, 70% of all consumers complain that their agents didn’t sufficiently communicate with them. You won’t get that from us because we include a communication guarantee in our agreement.&nbsp;

This guarantee states that we’ll communicate with you on a weekly basis, and that communication will consist of:

* How many showings your property’s had&nbsp;
* What the feedback was
* What proactive approach we need to take if any changes need to be made with the property

If you’re not happy with our level of service or you don’t feel fulfilled by our communication guarantee, you can fire us at any time.

Second, **we offer an easy exit listing agreement.** The No. 1 concern sellers have with going under contract with an agent is being tied down to a long-term contract, and we’ve removed that concern. If you’re not happy with our service at any time during the listing agreement, you can cancel it with no fees and no strings attached.&nbsp;

Finally, **we offer a flexible commission structure.** Most agents will lock you into a standard commission structure, but we offer you four different commission structures. This way, you can choose which option is best for you and your family.&nbsp;

If you have any more questions about what we can offer you or you’d like a free market analysis, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. My team and I would love to help you.
