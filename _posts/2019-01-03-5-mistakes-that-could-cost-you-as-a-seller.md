There are a number of pitfalls that you should avoid when selling your home and that I’ve sadly seen sellers make time and time again. Here are five of the most egregious:

**1. Overpricing.** The importance of properly pricing your home cannot be overstated. Even a well-priced home that isn’t being marketed to its full potential will still catch the eye of an eventual buyer, so don’t make the mistake of putting too high a price on the property.

**2. Failing to make simple repairs.** Be careful not to ignore plainly visible repairs before listing. Making those small fixes can safeguard you against possibly losing thousands of dollars on the sale. We recommend having a professional inspection conducted beforehand.

**3. Neglecting to declutter.** Listen to your Realtor’s advice on what needs to be removed from each room of your home. If your Realtor plans to take photos of your property, you’ll want to be sure that odds and ends and messy spaces are taken care of. Pictures of spruced up, organized rooms could make all the difference in buyer interest.

**4. Not allowing adequate access to the property.** Your schedule will need to be adaptable to buyers’ schedules. Being as flexible as possible will ensure a timely and satisfactory sale.

**5. Getting emotional about the sale.** Buyers will not be moved by all the memories that you and your family have made in the home. To them, the home is a product of the market that they’ll compare against other, similar listings. So reserve your emotions as much as possible.
