If you’re thinking of selling your home, listen up: There are four habits all successful home sellers have in common, and we’re going to share them with you now.

**1. Keep your home neat and tidy.** This is a good habit to have regardless of whether you’re selling or not, but it’s especially important while your home’s on the market. Keeping your property clean and decluttered will allow buyers to see it as a fresh slate. If you have pets, you’ll need to take the additional steps of removing any odors, hair, or damage that they might have left behind.&nbsp;

**2. Stay on top of general maintenance.** Cleaning the gutters, replacing light bulbs, and taking care of other tasks that might be on your to-do list is essential. Buyers often fall in love with a home before they even step through the front door, so make sure your home is in great shape inside and out.

**3. Maintain good communication with your agent.** In the age of the internet, it’s easy to think that doing your own research online is enough. However, the truth is that clear and consistent communication with an experienced, local real estate professional will always be best. There are certain things an agent can offer than no website can. As you plan (and execute) your sale, make sure to communicate with your agent at every step.&nbsp;

**4. Order a pre-listing inspection.** Getting the inspection out of the way before you list can make a massive difference in your success. Doing so offers you the chance to take care of anything that might be wrong with the property before it ever hits the market. Being able to present buyers with the full inspection report and proof that you’ve made the necessary repairs will definitely work in your favor.&nbsp;
