You’ve probably heard the buzz about so-called “iBuyer” companies, but is selling your home to an iBuyer really worth it? Today we’ll cover a few pros and cons, but first, let’s define what an iBuyer actually is.&nbsp;

**An iBuyer company is one that will buy your home outright for cash, therefore allowing you to avoid the open market and forgo certain contingencies.** There will be an inspection, but the findings will not likely break your sale. Instead, the company will simply reduce its offer price to account for the cost of repairs. In the Phoenix metro area, the top three iBuyer companies, also called “instant offer” companies, are Opendoor, Offerpad, and Zillow.

This arrangement is often touted as being more convenient than a traditional selling experience, but is it actually as good as some say? Let’s move on to the advantages and drawbacks of the iBuyer experience.

**First, selling to an instant offer company does allow you to avoid the open market, but the service fees will be much higher.** Not only that, you’ll also likely earn between $10,000 to $20,000 less than your home’s retail value. And given that the company will likely knock off even more money to accommodate certain repairs, as we mentioned earlier, you’re bound to walk away with a lot less in your pocket than you could have earned through a traditional sale.&nbsp;

Also, after they’ve bought your home, the company you work with will profit off of it by selling it to another buyer or investor.&nbsp;

The bottom line is this: **Unless you’re truly in dire straits, working with an iBuyer company is generally not the way to go.** The 5% to 6% commission you’d pay a traditional agent to sell your home is largely inconsequential when you realize how much more you can earn by going that route.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>If you have any other questions or would like to learn more about how my team and I can help you enjoy a convenient real estate experience without resorting to an “instant offer” arrangement, feel free to give us a call or send us an email.
