If you want to sell your home quickly and for top dollar, then don’t listen to these x pieces of outdated listing advice.&nbsp;

**1. “Wait until spring to sell.”** There may be more buyers in the market during the spring and summer months, but there are also more competing sellers. More competition equals less leverage, so, therefore, it’s often better to list sooner in the year. Plenty of homes sell successfully at any time of year, and sellers who list during a down time have a particular advantage.&nbsp;

**2. “Price your home high.”** Pricing high and working your way down through negotiations may sound like a good idea, but today’s buyers are too savvy to be fooled by this technique. Pricing your home correctly from the start will be a much more effective strategy for earning top dollar.&nbsp;

**3. “Leave room in your price for negotiation.”** Pricing too high isn’t the only value-related mistake you can make. Setting a price in hopes you’ll be able to change it once the offers start rolling in is never the way to go. Never set a price you wouldn’t be happy to accept at the closing table.

**4. “Sell your home as-is.”** &nbsp;Making certain strategic upgrades to your home can go a long way in helping you to sell quickly and for top dollar. These upgrades don’t need to be extreme. Even just a fresh coat of paint can make a massive difference.&nbsp;

**5. “Take your own listing photos.”** When it comes to showing your home in its best light, cell phone photos just won’t cut it. You’ll need the help of a professional photographer if you want your listing photos to make your home stand out. These photos often serve as a buyer’s first impression, given that the majority of today’s homebuyers begin their search online. Make that first impression a good one.&nbsp;
