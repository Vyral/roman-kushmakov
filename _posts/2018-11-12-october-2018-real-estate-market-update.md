We’re getting closer toward the end of the year, so we wanted to bring you up to speed on the real estate market. **Here are the numbers you need to know for the Phoenix market for October 2018:**

* We had 19,996 active listings in October 2018, which is down 2.9% from the 20,590 we saw at this time last year.
* We had 9,774 new listings, which is down 2% from the 9,974 we saw in October 2017.
* Sold listings were down 1.3%, from 7,424 in October 2017 to 7,325 in October 2018.
* Pending sales were down a massive 38.1%, from 7,518 last year to only 4,652 this year.
* Our absorption rate is up from 2.24 months to 2.47 months in just the last 30 days.

Based on these numbers, what is the market telling us? **We’re definitely still seeing multiple offers in certain areas of Phoenix, especially homes listed under $350,000.** Homes in the higher price ranges are seeing an increase in inventory and an increase in price reductions.
