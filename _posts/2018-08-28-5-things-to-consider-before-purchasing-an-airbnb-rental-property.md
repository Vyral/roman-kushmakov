With AirBnB becoming an increasingly popular way to rent out properties, many people ask me how to go about buying a property for this purpose. Personally, I always look at the same five things when I consider buying a short-term rental property.

**1. What amenities does the community have?** You need to consider the different amenities that are available with your purchase, such as a community pool, a gym, a recreational space, and walking or biking trails. Short-term tenants will enjoy having access to these places with your accommodation.

**2. What is in the surrounding area?** People who are renting short-term will Google the proximity of your property's location to shopping centers, entertainment, restaurants, nightlife, etc. The closer it is to these types of entertainment, the more likely you are to have more bookings which means more money for you.

**3. What is the rental rate for furnished rentals in the area?** Before you put an offer on the property, make sure either you or your Realtor does some research on the going rate for short-term and AirBnB rentals in the neighborhood. This will help you determine approximately how much you will make on the investment per month after expenses.

**4. What is the price of the property?** Going along with what you can charge, the price of the property will help determine what your return is. Sometimes buying the cheapest home in a bad neighborhood isn't the best option, because people won't want to stay there and you will have more vacancies. I have found that purchasing a property that needs work but is in a nice neighborhood can be a great option, because you can negotiate on a favorable price upon purchase and then remodel the home to earn a higher cash flow.

**5. Is it AirBnB eligible?** Some condo and townhome communities in Arizona, especially in Phoenix, don't allow short-term rentals, and instead require a three- to six-month minimum lease. This is why it’s important to do your research before putting an offer in on a home. If it is an HOA property, you can simply ask the HOA and they will guide you on what’s allowed. 

If you have any additional questions about this, please feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to speaking with you soon.
