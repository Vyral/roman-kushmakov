Today we're going to talk about how to increase your FICO score. I get this question all the time and **today I want to provide some answers that have helped both me and my past clients increase our scores substantially.**

Before giving you the tips, you need to understand that there are five components involved in the score. The two major ones are payment history and credit utilization. Payment history makes up 35% of your score, so it’s critical to pay your bills on time. **The easiest solution to this is setting up automatic payments so you don’t forget.**

Another great tip is to not use more than 30% of your credit limit on a monthly basis. If you have $5,000 limit on your card, don’t go out and spend $5,000. If you have to spend, only spend 30% of that limit, or $1500.

Finally, if you have a credit card that you’ve had for a couple of years and don’t use it much, don’t close it. **If it’s your longest trade line, it’s better to use it once in a while and keep it instead of getting rid of it.**

Hopefully these tips and tricks help you improve your score. If you have any questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
