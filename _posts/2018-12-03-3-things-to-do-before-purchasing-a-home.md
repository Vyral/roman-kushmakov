**Here are three steps that you must take before purchasing a home:**

**1. Figure out what you can afford.** This is critical. We recommend using a tool called Affordability Calculator to figure out what your budget should be. A good rule of thumb is to not spend more than 30% of your income on a mortgage. This will give you a good gauge of what you can afford on a monthly basis.

**2. Meet with a lender and get pre-qualified.** We recommend interviewing two lenders to see who has the best programs for you. There are three components to meeting a lender. First, you’ll figure out what your monthly payment will be. Then, you’ll find out what sale price you’re approved for. Finally, you’ll get a pre-qualification letter once they’ve approved you. This takes a lot of the stress out of the transaction.

**3. Hire the right Realtor.** You want to hire someone who has at least several years of experience dealing with buyers and sellers. You also want to hire someone who is an expert in your market and someone who can get you the best possible terms on your purchase with the least amount of hassle.
