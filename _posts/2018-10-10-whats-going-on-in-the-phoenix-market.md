In the Greater Phoenix Area this September, active listings were at 19,143. Comparing this to September of 2017, when there where 19,921, our current numbers represent a 3.9% drop in active listings.

There were 9,042 new listings on the market in September, which was a 6.3% decrease from this same time last year, when there were 9,646.

The number of sold listings last month was 7,027, which was a 6.4% drop over last year. For pending listings, or homes that were under contract, the decrease was significant—36.2%.

As of September 2018, we had 2.35 months of inventory on the market. Last year, there were 2.53 months’ worth so we saw a 6.5% drop.

**Here are the three key things I’m noticing:**

1. Inventory has been increasing steadily since May of this year.
2. Pending homes have dropped a whopping 36.2% over last year.
3. There have been more price adjustments in this market than we’ve seen in the past few years.

So what do all these numbers mean?

If you’re a seller trying to extract as much equity as you can from this home but you’re on the fence about jumping into the market, know that **now is definitely the time to sell.**

If you’re a buyer in search of a home and plan to stay there for a minimum of two or three years, now is a great time to leap on the opportunity. **Interest rates are historically low, so homes are still affordable.**

If you have any additional questions about the real estate market, feel free to reach out to me. I hope to hear from you soon.
